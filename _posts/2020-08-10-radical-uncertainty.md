These notes have been a lightly edited.


* (4:30) Human urge to quantify and seeking precision; experts pretending to know more than they do to expand and maintain influence; most big decisions are one-off and unique and need to be deliberated and dig deeper

* (7:20) case of deflecting responsibility in scientific and policy making - *have a single decision maker, accountability*
	
* (9:10) *Models to organise collective thinking and form narrative* - Helpful in teaching; not helpful in making quantitative predictions because of *black box parameters*

* (10:20) *Use of point estimates in policy making*

* (15:30) Use of cost-benefit analysis is a way to organise thoughts and setting a strategy; Wrong to quantify the net benefit at the end; value in unearthing drivers that are certain/uncertain.
	
* (18:00) Value at risk - Is there a better alternative? The debate of Best metric vs Best managerial response; Relying on arbitrary figures as regulatory benchmarks and not questioning the scenarios in-depth is the mistake
	
* (23:00) In light of the bailouts that happen during crisis, do companies have incentives to be prudent? [To be detailed]

* (25:00) Rationality - What is wrong with the current usage of rationality in economics and specifically behavioral economics? Rationality axioms (defined by Econs) plays well in a controlled small-world models but not appropriate in a large-world models abound in  radical uncertainties; Biases are evolutionary adaptations to an uncertain world; Decisions in government, business and personal life - are not characterised by small-world settings. 

* (30:50)  Behavioral Economics - what has gone wrong? Behavioral Economics Research shifting from *Models not conforming with People* (work of Maurice Allais, Daniel Ellsberg) to *People not conforming with Models* (work of Daniel Kahneman, Amos Tversky); Expected Utility - [To be detailed]

* (41:00) Under what circumstances can a market economy be efficient? [Arrow-Debreu Model] Can the market set be complete ? i.e markets for buying and selling of all contingent outcomes in the future? The (wrong) view that the world would be perfect if there existed a market for everything and then the market economy could self-correct  -> more and more financial instruments will complete the set of AD markets; Because the assumptions of AD model did not hold due to imperfect market with asymmetric outcomes.


*  (43:41) Human intelligence designed for large worlds and effective at dealing with uncertainty. Assumption of biases is implausible in light of the evolutionary origins of cognitive ability; Business owners are not optimising and maximising in real life (because information is absent); rather they are finding strategies that are ‘good enough’; Sequential vs. simultaneous option comparison made by decision makers.

*  (46:15) Fast-and-frugal decision making and power of rules-of-thumb in crisis environment by *Gerd Gigerenzer* vs. simulated setting; Computers are great at solving well-defined, scoped problems at lightning speed whereas human minds have the capacity of making leaps of imagination to deal and solve ill-defined problems

* (49:56) decisions/reality as opaque; Do humans have a natural inclination to think of (ill-defined) mysteries as (well-defined) puzzles; or do we despise certainty (groundhog day) and like uncertainty (elements of surprise) in everyday life?

*  (52:21) managing risk and embracing uncertainty; Keynes and Knight called out the distinction between risk and uncertainty.

* (56:40) What is wrong with the as-if assumptions made by Chicago school of thought; equating economics to physics as a field with equations and data but not applying the self-correcting behaviour of improving knowledge (found in physics).

* (1:03:00) Fallacy of *dropping* as-if assumptions after model is confirmed and not going back and revising/ is prevalent in risk management, policy making.

* (1:06:40) Robert Skidelski quote - economics is not a progressive science; state of deductive (lot), inductive (little), abductive (very little) reasoning applied in economics. [Charles Sanders Peirce work on reasoning]; deductive and inductive do not have the tools to provide advice to business, policy and society; decisions in the real world involve a significant degree of abductive reasoning.
