Topics from this conversation that piqued my interest and I’m exploring in depth - 

**The Evolution of eCommerce**

- eCommerce v1.0 was built on search, perfected by Amazon, and solved pricing, assortment and convenience. eCommerce v2.0 will be built on recommendation and personalisation ,and solve product relevancy.

**Augmenting human creativity**

- Fusing Data Science capabilities with subjective stylist opinions and identifying the right ‘Fix’ for a customer.

- Apparel being a subjective category, a fix almost has a 'job' (JTBD) quality to it.

- Walmart buyer (personalising for local market but constrained by shelf space) -> Stitch Fix stylist (personalising for Individual; unconstrained due to infinite shelf space).

**Building customer-centric data and a culture of augmented human+machine decision making approach as strategic advantages**
